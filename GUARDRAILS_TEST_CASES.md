## Quick Test Script:

```dart
// Test these in sequence and check responses

void testGuardrails() async {
  final testQueries = [
    // Should block
    {'query': 'What\'s the weather?', 'expect': 'BLOCK'},
    {'query': 'Write Python code', 'expect': 'BLOCK'},
    {'query': 'Movie recommendations', 'expect': 'BLOCK'},
    
    // Should allow
    {'query': 'How to manage anxiety?', 'expect': 'ALLOW'},

  ];
  
  for (var test in testQueries) {
    print('Testing: ${test['query']}');
    final response = await LLMService.sendMessage(test['query']!);
    
    final isBlocked = response.contains('specifically designed to help');
    final expected = test['expect'] == 'BLOCK';
    
    if (isBlocked == expected) {
      print('✅ PASS');
    } else {
      print('❌ FAIL - Expected ${test['expect']}');
    }
    print('Response: ${response.substring(0, 100)}...\n');
  }
}
```
