# Quick Reference - Text Truncation Fix

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **`lib/services/api_service.dart`**
   - Added `truncate: false` parameter
   - Added `maxLength: 5000` parameter
   - Both sent to backend API

2. **`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`**
   - Updated API call to request full responses
   - Set `truncate: false` and `maxLength: 5000`

## üß™ Test It Now

1. **Run your app**
2. **Ask a question that previously got truncated:**
   - "How are you?"
   - "I am not doing too good"
   - "Tell me about mental health"

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Full responses without "[Response truncated...]" message
   - Complete answers up to 5000 characters

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Adjust Settings

If responses are still too short/long, edit `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`:

```dart
final queryResponse = await ApiService.queryFaq(
  userMessage,
  truncate: false,        // Keep as false
  maxLength: 10000,       // ‚Üê Change this number
);
```

**Recommended values:**
- `5000` - Good balance (current setting)
- `10000` - Very long responses
- `3000` - Shorter, concise answers

## üîç If Still Truncated

The backend API may not support these parameters yet. If responses are still truncated:

### Check Backend Support
The backend at `https://sepokonayuma-mental-health-faq.hf.space/faq` needs to:
- Accept `truncate` parameter
- Accept `max_length` parameter
- Return full responses when `truncate: false`

### Contact Backend Developer
Ask them to:
1. Support `truncate` boolean parameter
2. Support `max_length` integer parameter
3. Return complete responses when requested

### Alternative: Client-Side "Show More"
If backend can't be modified immediately, we can add a "Show More" button in the chat UI to expand truncated responses.

## üìä Current Settings Summary

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `truncate` | `false` | Request full responses |
| `maxLength` | `5000` | Allow up to 5000 characters |
| `topK` | `5` | Get top 5 results (only best shown) |
| `minScore` | `0.0` | No minimum score filter |

## ‚ú® Benefits

- **Complete Information**: Users get full answers
- **Better Experience**: No need to ask "tell me more"
- **Professional**: Responses feel complete and authoritative
- **Flexible**: Easy to adjust length limits

## üöÄ Result

Users will now see complete responses like:

```
Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated.

You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique.

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences 
that you do. Everyone faces their own challenges when it comes to 
drinking alcohol. What matters most is understanding your own 
relationship with alcohol and making informed decisions about your 
health and wellbeing.
```

Instead of:
