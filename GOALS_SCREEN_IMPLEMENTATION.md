### Files Modified

- `ONBOARDING_FLOW.md` (updated with goals screen info)

## User Experience

1. User sees "What brings you here?" title
2. Subtitle says "Select all that apply"
3. User taps one or more goals
4. Each selection shows blue checkmark
5. User taps "Continue" button
6. If no goals selected ‚Üí Orange warning
7. If goals selected ‚Üí Navigate to next screen

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```dart
final Set<String> _selectedGoals = {};

void _toggleGoal(String goalId) {
  setState(() {
    if (_selectedGoals.contains(goalId)) {
      _selectedGoals.remove(goalId);
    } else {
      _selectedGoals.add(goalId);
    }
  });
}
```

### Checkbox Visual Feedback
- Unselected: Gray border circle
- Selected: Blue filled circle with white checkmark
- Tap anywhere on the card to toggle

### Validation
```dart
if (_selectedGoals.isEmpty) {
  // Show error: "Please select at least one goal"
  return;
}
```

## Next Steps

### To Complete Onboarding

**Need:** Figma node ID for the 3rd and final onboarding screen

Once provided, I'll:
1. Fetch design from Figma
2. Create Flutter screen
3. Wire up navigation: Goals Selection ‚Üí Screen 3 ‚Üí Chat
4. Complete the onboarding flow

### Future Enhancement (Optional)

The selected goals are currently printed to console:
```dart
print('Selected goals: $_selectedGoals');
```

You can later save these to the user's profile in Supabase:
```dart
await supabase.from('user_profiles').update({
  'goals': _selectedGoals.toList(),
}).eq('user_id', user.id);
```
