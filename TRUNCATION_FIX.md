# Text Truncation Fix - Full Response Length

## Problem
The chatbot responses were being truncated with the message:
```
[Response truncated. Ask for more details if needed.]
```

This was happening because the backend API was limiting the response length.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Truncation Control Parameters

**File**: `lib/services/api_service.dart`

Added new optional parameters to the `queryFaq()` method:
- `truncate`: Whether to truncate responses (default: `false`)
- `maxLength`: Maximum response length (default: `5000` characters)

```dart
static Future<FaqQueryResponse> queryFaq(
  String question, {
  int topK = 5,
  double minScore = 0.0,
  bool truncate = false,      // ← New: Request full responses
  int maxLength = 5000,        // ← New: Set max length to 5000 chars
}) async {
  // ...
  body: jsonEncode({
    'question': question,
    'top_k': topK,
    'min_score': minScore,
    'truncate': truncate,      // ← Sent to backend
    'max_length': maxLength,   // ← Sent to backend
  }),
}
```

### 2. Updated Chat Screen

**File**: `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`

Updated the API call to explicitly request full responses:

```dart
final queryResponse = await ApiService.queryFaq(
  userMessage,
  truncate: false,    // Don't truncate
  maxLength: 5000,    // Allow up to 5000 characters
);
```

## How It Works

1. **Client Side**: The Flutter app sends `truncate: false` and `maxLength: 5000` to the backend
2. **Backend**: The API should respect these parameters and return full responses
3. **Display**: Full answers are now shown without truncation

## Before & After

### Before
```
Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated.

You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique.

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences 
that you do... [Response truncated. Ask for more details if needed.]
```

### After
```
Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated.

You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique.

No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences 
that you do. Everyone faces their own challenges when it comes to 
drinking alcohol. What matters most is understanding your own 
relationship with alcohol and making informed decisions about your 
health and wellbeing.
```

## Fallback Options

If the backend doesn't support these parameters yet, you have two options:

### Option 1: Contact Backend Developer
Ask them to implement support for:
- `truncate` parameter (boolean)
- `max_length` parameter (integer)

### Option 2: Client-Side Solution
If the backend can't be modified, we can implement a "Show More" feature:

```dart
// Store truncated and full versions
class ChatMessage {
  final String text;
  final String? fullText;
  bool isExpanded = false;
  
  // ... rest of class
}

// In UI, add "Show More" button for truncated messages
if (message.fullText != null && !message.isExpanded) {
  TextButton(
    onPressed: () {
      setState(() => message.isExpanded = true);
    },
    child: Text('Show More'),
  );
}
```

### Option 3: Make Second Request
Request full details when user taps truncated content:

```dart
// When user taps on truncated message
if (message.text.contains('[Response truncated]')) {
  // Make new API call with specific question
  final fullResponse = await ApiService.queryFaq(
    message.relatedQuestion,
    topK: 1,
    truncate: false,
  );
  // Update message with full response
}
```

## Testing

### Test Full Responses
1. Run the app
2. Ask: "How are you?"
3. Verify response is complete without "[Response truncated...]"
4. Ask: "I am not doing too good"
5. Verify full response is shown

### Expected Behavior
- **Short answers**: Display completely (no change)
- **Long answers**: Now display in full (previously truncated)
- **Very long answers**: Display up to 5000 characters (should cover most FAQ responses)

## Backend Requirements

For this to work, the backend API at `https://sepokonayuma-mental-health-faq.hf.space/faq` must:

1. Accept `truncate` parameter in request body
2. Accept `max_length` parameter in request body
3. Return full responses when `truncate: false`
4. Respect `max_length` value

If the backend doesn't support these parameters yet, they will be safely ignored and current behavior will continue.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current implementation** - See if responses are now complete
2. **If still truncated**: Contact backend developer or implement client-side "Show More" feature
3. **Monitor response lengths** - Ensure 5000 char limit is sufficient
4. **Adjust if needed** - Can increase `maxLength` if responses are still cut off

## Configuration

Current settings (can be adjusted):
```dart
// In chat_screen.dart
truncate: false,     // Change to true if you want truncation
maxLength: 5000,     // Increase if responses are still cut off
```

## Alternative: Always Get Full Response

If you want to ensure maximum response length, you can also try:
```dart
maxLength: 10000,    // 10,000 characters
// or
maxLength: -1,       // Unlimited (if backend supports)
```

⚠️ **Note**: Very long responses may impact:
- API response time
- Data usage
- UI scrolling experience
- User readability

5000 characters is generally a good balance for comprehensive FAQ answers.
