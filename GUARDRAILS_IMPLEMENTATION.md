# Guardrails Implementation - Mental Health App

## Overview
Comprehensive content filtering and scope enforcement to ensure AI responses stay focused on mental health and wellness topics only.

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

### 1. **Pre-Request Filtering**
Before sending any message to the AI models, the system checks if the query is within scope.

```dart
if (!_isWithinScope(message)) {
  return _getOutOfScopeResponse();
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Gemini System Prompt**
Strict instructions to Gemini AI to only respond to mental health topics:
- Explicit scope limitations
- Clear refusal guidelines for off-topic queries
- Response format requirements
- Crisis support guidelines

### 3. **Post-Response Validation**
Even after getting a response from Gemini, the system checks if it stayed on topic:
```dart
if (_isResponseOffTopic(generatedText)) {
  return _getOutOfScopeResponse();
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Layers

### Layer 1: Input Validation (`_isWithinScope`)

**Blocked Topics:**
- ‚ùå Programming/Tech: "write code", "javascript", "python", "html", etc.
- ‚ùå Current Events/Politics: "election", "president", "government", etc.
- ‚ùå Shopping/Commerce: "buy", "purchase", "shop", "price", etc.
- ‚ùå Entertainment: "movie recommendation", "tv show", "netflix", etc.
- ‚ùå Weather: "weather", "temperature", "forecast", etc.
- ‚ùå Sports: "football score", "basketball", "game score", etc.
- ‚ùå Travel: "flight", "hotel", "vacation", "travel to", etc.
- ‚ùå Food/Recipes: "recipe for", "how to cook", "bake", etc.
- ‚ùå Science/Math: "solve equation", "calculate", "physics", etc.
- ‚ùå Harmful/Illegal: "how to harm", "drugs", "hack", etc.

**Exception Handling:**
Even if a blocked keyword is detected, the query is allowed if it has clear mental health context.

Example:
- ‚ùå "What's the weather?" ‚Üí Blocked
- ‚úÖ "Weather affects my anxiety, how can I cope?" ‚Üí Allowed

### Layer 2: Mental Health Context Detection (`_hasMentalHealthContext`)

**Approved Keywords:**
- ‚úÖ mental health, anxiety, depression, stress, therapy
- ‚úÖ counseling, wellbeing, wellness, mood, emotion
- ‚úÖ feeling, cope, coping, mental, psychological
- ‚úÖ mindfulness, meditation, self-care, support
- ‚úÖ struggling, overwhelmed, worried, fear, panic
- ‚úÖ sad, lonely, exhausted, burnout, trauma

### Layer 3: Gemini System Prompt

**Strict Instructions:**
```
STRICT SCOPE LIMITATIONS:
- You ONLY respond to questions about mental health, emotional wellbeing, 
  stress, anxiety, depression, self-care, mindfulness, and related wellness topics.
- You MUST REFUSE to answer questions about: programming, current events, 
  politics, shopping, weather, sports, entertainment recommendations, recipes, 
  general knowledge, or any non-mental-health topics.
- If asked about topics outside mental health, politely redirect the user 
  back to mental health topics.
```

### Layer 4: Response Validation (`_isResponseOffTopic`)

**Post-Generation Check:**
Analyzes the AI's response for off-topic indicators:
- Recipe/cooking terms
- Movie/entertainment references
- Weather information
- Sports scores
- Shopping/pricing details
- Programming code
- Political content

**Triggers:**
- 2+ off-topic indicators detected
- No mental health context in response
- Response is suspiciously short (<20 characters)

## üìã Out-of-Scope Response

When a query is blocked, users receive a helpful redirect:

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Should Be Blocked:

1. **General Knowledge:**
   - ‚ùå "What's the capital of France?"
   - ‚ùå "How do I write a Python function?"
   - ‚ùå "What's the weather today?"

2. **Entertainment:**
   - ‚ùå "Recommend a good movie"
   - ‚ùå "What's on Netflix?"
   - ‚ùå "Best TV shows to watch"

3. **Shopping:**
   - ‚ùå "Where can I buy shoes?"
   - ‚ùå "What's the price of iPhone?"
   - ‚ùå "Best deals on Amazon"

4. **Current Events:**
   - ‚ùå "Who won the election?"
   - ‚ùå "Latest news about the war"
   - ‚ùå "Political situation in..."

### Should Be Allowed:

1. **Mental Health Questions:**
   - ‚úÖ "How do I manage anxiety?"
   - ‚úÖ "Tips for dealing with depression"
   - ‚úÖ "I'm feeling overwhelmed, what should I do?"

2. **Wellness Topics:**

   - ‚úÖ "Social media affects my mental health"
   - ‚úÖ "Weather changes trigger my depression"

## üîÑ Both Models Protected

### Mindful Companion (Custom SLM):
- Pre-request filtering applies
- If blocked, returns out-of-scope message
- If allowed, queries FAQ database
- Low-confidence responses already handled in API

### Gemini Wisdom:
- Pre-request filtering applies
- Enhanced system prompt enforces scope
- Post-response validation catches drift
- Multi-layer protection against off-topic responses

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### Valid Query:
```
User: "How do I cope with stress?"
    ‚Üì
Pass _isWithinScope() ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Route to selected model
    ‚Üì
Get response
    ‚Üì
Pass _isResponseOffTopic() ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Display helpful response
```

### Invalid Query:
```
User: "What's the weather?"
    ‚Üì
Fail _isWithinScope() ‚ùå
    ‚Üì
Return _getOutOfScopeResponse()
    ‚Üì
Display redirect message with crisis resources
```

### Gemini Drift Detection:
```
User: "Tell me about anxiety and movies"
    ‚Üì
Pass _isWithinScope() ‚úÖ (has mental health context)
    ‚Üì
Send to Gemini
    ‚Üì
Gemini responds about movie recommendations
    ‚Üì
Fail _isResponseOffTopic() ‚ùå
    ‚Üì
Return _getOutOfScopeResponse() instead
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Adjusting Sensitivity:

**More Strict:**
```dart
// Increase threshold in _isResponseOffTopic
if (offTopicCount >= 1 && !_hasMentalHealthContext(lowerResponse)) {
  return true; // Block with just 1 indicator
}
```

**More Lenient:**
```dart
// Increase threshold
if (offTopicCount >= 3 && !_hasMentalHealthContext(lowerResponse)) {
  return true; // Block only with 3+ indicators
}
```

### Adding Keywords:

**Block New Topic:**
```dart
// In _isWithinScope, add to outOfScopeKeywords:
'cryptocurrency', 'bitcoin', 'trading',
```

**Allow New Context:**
```dart
// In _hasMentalHealthContext, add to mentalHealthKeywords:
'ptsd', 'ocd', 'adhd', 'bipolar',
```

## üìä Benefits

### 1. **User Safety**
- Prevents harmful or inappropriate content
- Ensures users get relevant mental health support
- Maintains app's therapeutic purpose

### 2. **Brand Consistency**
- All responses align with mental health focus
- Professional, specialized assistance
- Clear boundaries and expectations

### 3. **Resource Efficiency**
- Avoid wasting API calls on off-topic queries
- Quick rejection of irrelevant questions
- Optimized for mental health domain

### 4. **Legal/Compliance**
- Clear scope limitations
- Appropriate disclaimers
- Crisis resource provision

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Borderline Topics
**Example:** "I'm stressed about work deadlines"
- ‚úÖ Allowed (contains "stressed")
- Focus on stress management
- Ignore work details unless relevant

### 2. Multiple Topics
**Example:** "Anxiety about sports performance"
- ‚úÖ Allowed (contains "anxiety")
- Address mental health aspect
- Sports context is secondary

### 3. Typos/Variations
```dart
// Consider adding fuzzy matching for common typos
'anxeity' ‚Üí 'anxiety'
'stres' ‚Üí 'stress'
'depresion' ‚Üí 'depression'
```

### 4. Non-English Queries
Current implementation: English keywords only
Future enhancement: Multi-language support

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. **Machine Learning Classification**
Train a classifier to detect mental health queries:
```dart
static Future<bool> _isWithinScope(String message) async {
  final prediction = await MLClassifier.classify(message);
  return prediction.category == 'mental_health';
}
```

### 2. **User Feedback Loop**
```dart
// Allow users to report false positives/negatives
static void reportMisclassification(String message, bool shouldBeAllowed) {
  // Log for model improvement
}
```

### 3. **Confidence Scoring**
```dart
static ScopeCheck _checkScope(String message) {
  return ScopeCheck(
    isAllowed: true,
    confidence: 0.85,
    reason: 'Contains mental health keywords',
  );
}
```

### 4. **Dynamic Keyword Updates**
Fetch updated keyword lists from server:
```dart
static Future<void> updateKeywords() async {
  final keywords = await ApiService.getKeywordList();
  _outOfScopeKeywords = keywords.blocked;
  _mentalHealthKeywords = keywords.allowed;
}
```
