## 🌍 Why This Matters

### US Numbers Don't Work in Zambia
❌ **988** - Not accessible from Zambia  
❌ **741741** - US-only text service  
❌ **911** - Different emergency number system  

### Zambian Numbers Are Local
✅ **933** - Works within Zambia's phone network  
✅ **116** - Government-supported helpline  
✅ **991** - Official medical emergency  
✅ **999** - Official police emergency

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Localization is Critical
- Emergency numbers vary by country
- US-centric defaults don't work globally
- Always use local resources

### 2. Single Source of Truth
- Keep one authoritative source (safety_note_screen.dart)
- Propagate changes to all dependent locations
- Maintain consistency

### 3. User Safety First
- Inaccessible crisis resources can be dangerous
- Local numbers connect immediately
- Cultural context matters

### 4. Documentation Matters
- Update all docs when code changes
- Include visual comparisons
- Make changes easy to verify

---

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

### To Update Crisis Resources in Future:

1. **Primary Update Location:**
   - Edit `lib/screens/safety_note_screen.dart` first
   - This is the single source of truth

2. **Secondary Update Locations:**
   - `lib/services/llm_service.dart` - `_getOutOfScopeResponse()`
   - `lib/services/llm_service.dart` - Gemini system prompt
   - All documentation .md files

3. **Verification:**
   - Search codebase for old numbers
   - Test guardrails with off-topic queries
   - Check Gemini responses include new resources
   - Verify safety screen matches
