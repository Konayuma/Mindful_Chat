## 🔍 How It Works

### Simple Flow:
```
1. User sends message
2. Check: Is it mental health related?
   ├─ NO  → Show redirect message
   └─ YES → Send to AI model
3. Get AI response
4. Check: Did AI stay on topic?
   ├─ NO  → Show redirect message
   └─ YES → Display to user
```

### Protection Layers:
1. **Pre-Filter**: Block off-topic before AI
2. **Context**: Allow edge cases with mental health context
3. **AI Prompt**: Tell AI to refuse off-topic
4. **Post-Check**: Verify AI stayed focused

// In lib/services/llm_service.dart, line ~75
final outOfScopeKeywords = [
  // ... existing
  'new_blocked_word',
];
```

### Add Allowed Keyword:
```dart
// In lib/services/llm_service.dart, line ~122
final mentalHealthKeywords = [
  // ... existing
  'new_mental_health_term',
];
```

### Adjust Sensitivity:
```dart
// In _isResponseOffTopic(), line ~178
if (offTopicCount >= 2) { // Change number
  return true;
}
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: Mental health query blocked
**Fix:** Add keywords to `mentalHealthKeywords` list

### Issue: Off-topic query allowed
**Fix:** Add keywords to `outOfScopeKeywords` list

### Issue: Too many false positives
**Fix:** Increase threshold in `_isResponseOffTopic()`

### Issue: Too many false negatives
**Fix:** Decrease threshold, add more keywords
